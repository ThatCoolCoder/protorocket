# protorocket
Various prototypes for rocket and orbital mechanics simulation in Godot

## Structure of projects
The folder`/Common/` contains code for the "launcher" and utility code that could be used by the other prototypes. 

## Conventions used
All domain units are SI base units (m, kg, s). This makes math easy. Angles are in radians unless specified.
